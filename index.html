                    <p class="mb-5">Pedigree dogs and cats are not inherently more healthy than non-pedigree. A pedigree certificate is a family tree for that individual, not evidence for health. How healthy or well 'designed' those individuals are depends on how the breeder selects the animals that are to be bred. This is where health testing comes in to the decision-making process, choosing dogs that do not carry genes or physical features that will cause disease in the next generation.</p>

                    <p>Years of inbreeding and breeding for appearance have caused high rates of inherited diseases in purebred dogs, and to a lesser extent in cats. Breeding for extreme features has led to many dogs suffering from painful conditions all their life, such as heart, skin, joint and breathing problems. Some breeds such as the French Bulldog face a significantly reduced lifespan as a result of their disease. Sadly, their life expectancy in the UK is now only four and a half years.</p>

                        <p>Some breeds have severe genetic diseases that can cause suffering, making breeding them in their current state questionable. Testing the breeding 'parents' for disease and only breeding from those that do not carry genes detrimental to health is a big step in the right direction. Not all tests are essential every time in every breed, but a consideration for the risks of disease and using the tests that can help rule out that disease, are important.</p>

                        <p>Health tests before breeding and the costs, vary considerably between breeds depending on the inherited conditions they suffer from. This can affect the cost of a puppy or kitten but will be a good investment for future health and welfare. However, a high price does not guarantee good breeding.</p>

There is much more to breeding than genetic testing, the family history of health and disease, and the physical health of the parents are all important.</p>

                        <p>Breeding two or more breeds together (cross-breeding) or breeding two unrelated of the same breed (outcrossing) can help to dilute the gene pool. Kennel or breed clubs often resist this as they are working towards a 'standard' description of a purebred dog. This can result in closely related individuals producing puppies.</p>

                    <p>Health testing is not a golden bullet to solve all issues faced by dogs and cats today, but it is a big step in the right direction! Having a clear understanding of what a moderate looking, healthy dog or cat looks like, is a good place to start. Pedigree cats are usually the ones that suffer from inherited disease rather than 'moggies'. They should not have a squashed face, short legs or folded ears and they should have a full coat of fur. It might seem obvious, but there are some poor alien creatures out there! Dogs should not have overly long backs, very short legs, a squashed face or multiple, thick folds of skin. Ears should not be overly long or short, and should ideally stand erect. Dogs and cats should be able to breathe silently, sleep peacefully, run energetically and have a positive, friendly disposition to be an ideal family pet. This site will guide you through the process, helping with considerations and conflicts you may have.</p>

                            <p>The Kennel Club (KC) is a registration of specific dog breeds, designed through breeding over generations, to fit a certain look. The KC describes the 'perfect' example of dog breeds in what is called a 'Breed Standard'. These do not necessarily take into consideration the health of the individual. They may encourage extreme features that are harmful to the welfare of the individuals. The 'Pedigree' is a family tree for the puppy, it does not represent health.</p>

                            <p>Buying a mixed breed dog may convey some health benefits, although they may not live longer than pedigrees, their quality of life may be better than those with parents exhibiting more exaggerated characteristics. "Hybrid vigor" refers to the possibility of health benefits from crossbreeding, while "inbred" denotes closely related dog matings, reflected in the "coefficient of inbreeding" (COI) on some dog group websites. However, some mixes are NOT recommended e.g. Poodle and French bulldog, Sharpei and French bulldog and other crosses between two breeds that have multiple issues already.</p>

                            <p>Run! If your breeder doesn't meet these standards, walk away. It's not worth the stress or expense of dealing with a sick or aggressive dog. There are plenty of responsible breeders out there, even for rare breeds. It's better to choose someone who genuinely cares about the dogs rather than a breeder who disappears when issues arise. Did you know that responsibly bred dogs rarely end up in shelters? Responsible breeders require their puppies to be returned if they can't be cared for. By choosing them, you're supporting people who keep dogs out of shelters and not those who contribute to the problem. If everyone did this, fewer dogs would need rescuing.</p>
