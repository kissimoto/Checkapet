                    <p class="mb-5">Mixed breeds are generally healthier than pedigrees. A pedigree certificate is just a family tree. It does not reflect the health of the animal. What really matters is how carefully the breeder chooses which animals to breed. This is where health testing comes in. Good breeders use these tests to avoid passing on genes or physical traits that cause health problems.</p>

                    <p>Decades of inbreeding to achieve a certain look has reduced the gene pool in many popular breeds. This in turn is causing high rates of inherited diseases in purebred dogs, and to a lesser extent cats. Some breeds such as the French Bulldog face a significantly reduced lifespan as a result of their diseases. Shockingly, their life expectancy in the UK is now only four and a half years.</p>

Whatever it is, it will be a good investment for the future health and welfare of your new arrival. Don't be fooled, the high price of a puppy or kitten does NOT guarantee good breeding.</p>

                        <p>Breeding for health is not as straight forward as just having the parents tested. It is far more complex than that. Their physical health at the time of breeding is equally important. Is the mother old, overweight, does she have allergies... It is really important that the parents are health checked by a vet before breeding.</p>

                        <p>Breeding two different breeds (cross-breeding) or unrelated dogs of the same breed (outcrossing) can help broaden the gene pool. However, Kennel and breed clubs often resist this approach in favour of maintaining a defined breed 'standard', which can lead to the repeated breeding of closely related dogs (inbreeding).</p>

                    <p>Health testing isn't the <b>golden bullet</b>, but it is a key step to improve the lives of dogs and cats. <br>
                        A good starting point is understanding what a healthy, moderate looking pet should be.<br>
                        Pedigree cats are more prone to inherited diseases than 'moggies'. They should not have a full coat and avoid extreme features like flat faces, short legs or folded ears.
                        Sadly, some cats are bred to look more like fantasy creatures than animals.<br>
                         Dogs too, should avoid extreme traits; no overly long backs, very short legs, flat faces or heavy skin folds. Ears should be a sensible length and ideally upright. <br>
                         Most importantly pets should breathe easily, sleep soundly, run freely and have a calm, friendly nature to be great family companions.<br>

Consumers have the power to support responsible breeders and reject those who do not care. Buying from breeders who show low standards of welfare (also known as 'greeders'), encourages them to continue their 'greeding'.</p>
                    <p>Of course, not all disease can be prevented, but many inherited issues causing illness can be avoided by choosing healthy parents. Some illnesses can be identified by health-test, while others are only visible in the appearance of the animal.</p>

                            <p>Cross-breeds are a mix of two different purebreds, whereas a mixed-breed is more like a mutt, sometimes called a Heinz 57 (parentage is not known). The quality of life of cross-breeds may be better than their purebred parents. The term <b>hybrid vigour</b> refers to the possible health benefits of crossbreeding, while "inbred" denotes closely related dog matings. However, some mixes are NOT recommended e.g. Poodle and French bulldog, Sharpei and French bulldog and other crosses that have multiple issues already.</p>

                            <p>Run! If your breeder doesn't meet these standards, walk away. It's not worth the stress or expense of dealing with a sick or aggressive dog. There are plenty of responsible breeders out there, even for rare breeds. It's better to choose someone who genuinely cares about the dogs rather than a breeder who disappears when issues arise. Did you know that responsibly bred dogs rarely end up in shelters? Responsible breeders require their puppies to be returned if they can't be cared for. By choosing them, you're supporting people who keep dogs out of shelters and not those who contribute to the problem. If everyone did this, fewer dogs would need rescuing.</p>
