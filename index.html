                        <p>The place to find a healthy, happy new family member and a bright start to life. At CheckAPet we only feature breeders who prioritise health, welfare and temperament. Health testing is mandatory for breeding dogs and cats, if their offspring are advertised on this site. The offspring will be much more likely to have healthier and so happier lives as a result of reducing the risk of inherited disease. Most puppies sold in the UK are not from Kennel Club registered breeders. There is no restriction on who can breed, and we want to support those who test parents so as to reduce the risk of inherited disease in the offspring. We are committed to supporting responsible breeders who are making a positive change. Explore the various breeds and their crosses on this site and educate yourself on what a healthy dog looks like. Always ensure the breed you choose matches your family’s lifestyle, before committing to your new family member!</p>

                        <h2>The Consequences of Inbreeding and Extreme Breeding Practices</h2>
                        <p>Pedigree dogs and cats are not inherently more healthy than non-pedigree. A pedigree certificate is a family tree for that individual, not evidence for health. How healthy or well designed those individuals are depends on how the breeder selects the animals that are to be bred. This is where health testing comes in to the decision-making process, choosing dogs that do not carry genes or physical features that will cause disease in the next generation.</p>

                    <p>Years of inbreeding and breeding for appearance have caused high rates of inherited diseases in purebred dogs, and to a lesser extent in cats. Breeding for extreme features has led to many dogs suffering from painful conditions all their life, such as heart, skin, joint and breathing problems. Some breeds such as the French Bulldog face a significantly reduced lifespan as a result. Sadly, their life expectancy in the UK is now only four and a half years.</p>

Offered a blanket to bring home that smelled of mum and litter environment.  Has been involved with the breed and breeding for several years. May have a waiting list, indicating they breed based on demand rather than just to produce puppies. Signed puppy contract, microchip details, usually a first vaccine, insurance and advice on puppy care.  Has a detailed socialisation plan for puppies, including noise desensitisation with exposure to household noises, exposure to new surfaces and objects, interaction with people/gentle children and other animals, car rides, and household experiences.

                                    <p>A crossbreed, also known as a mixed-breed, is a dog whose parents are of different breeds, or a mix of several breeds. Crossbreeds can make wonderful family pets. Like purebred dogs, crossbreeds can be affected by inherited health conditions. However, a well-bred crossbreed is less likely to be affected by the breed-specific conditions that affect purebreds. It is still important to ask breeders of crossbreeds about the health of the parents.  A first generation cross-breed is known as an F1.  A second generation cross-breed (F2) is the result of breeding two F1s together.  Breeding F1s together is not recommended as the puppies can inherit a double dose of any undesirable genes.  The same applies to F3 generations.</p>

                                     <p>Munchkin cats and Scottish Folds are breeds that are known to have significant health problems.  Munchkin cats have a genetic mutation that causes their legs to be abnormally short.  This can lead to joint problems and other health issues.  Scottish Folds have a genetic mutation that affects cartilage development, leading to painful and debilitating arthritis.  For these reasons, we do not feature these breeds on our site.</p>
